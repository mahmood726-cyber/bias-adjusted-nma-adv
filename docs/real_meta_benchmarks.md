# Real Meta-Analysis Benchmarks

Checked: 2026-07-15

This document records source-backed real-data benchmarks. These benchmarks are validation evidence only when the tests and generated artifacts pass; they are not superiority claims.

## Source Boundary

Real-world validation inputs are restricted to:

- ClinicalTrials.gov public records;
- PubMed abstracts;
- open-access papers.

Closed IPD, proprietary trial reports, secondary package fixtures, and unverified inline demo numbers are not admissible validation sources.

## Benchmark 1: SGLT2 Inhibitors In Heart Failure

Dataset: `validation/real_meta/sglt2_hf_primary_events.csv`

Source manifest: `validation/real_meta/sglt2_hf_primary_sources.toml`

Outcome: primary composite outcome in each trial, harmonized as worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death / cardiovascular death or heart-failure hospitalization.

Scale currently tested: log odds ratio, because the current arm-level binary model estimates log-odds contrasts.

| Trial | NCT | PMID | Active events / n | Placebo events / n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAPA-HF | NCT03036124 | 31535829 | 386 / 2373 | 502 / 2371 |
| EMPEROR-Reduced | NCT03057977 | 32865377 | 361 / 1863 | 462 / 1867 |
| DELIVER | NCT03619213 | 36027570 | 512 / 3131 | 610 / 3132 |
| EMPEROR-Preserved | NCT03057951 | 34449189 | 415 / 2997 | 511 / 2991 |

Current tests:

- validate all rows against the allowed source boundary;
- validate a separate source manifest requiring matching trial labels, NCT IDs, PMIDs, outcomes, arm counts, and admissible PubMed/ClinicalTrials.gov URLs;
- compute an independent inverse-variance fixed-effect log-odds-ratio reference;
- compute source-backed study-level log-odds-ratio effects with NCT/PMID provenance;
- run the experimental pairwise bridge as fixed effect and REML-HKSJ with prediction interval;
- run the frequentist candidate model on the same rows;
- run the Bayesian MCMC candidate model on the same rows;
- require the pairwise fixed-effect result to match the independent fixed-effect reference exactly within numerical tolerance;
- require the frequentist result to match the independent fixed-effect reference exactly within numerical tolerance;
- require the Bayesian posterior mean to be directionally and numerically compatible with the same reference.

Current local benchmark contract: `validation/real_meta/sglt2_hf_primary_benchmark.toml`.

| Engine | Estimate | SE / posterior SD | 95% interval |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Independent fixed-effect logOR | -0.268984 | 0.036297 | -0.340125 to -0.197843 |
| Experimental pairwise fixed effect | -0.268984 | 0.036297 | -0.340125 to -0.197843 |
| Experimental pairwise REML-HKSJ | -0.268984 | 0.036297 | -0.384497 to -0.153470 |
| Candidate frequentist model | -0.268984 | 0.036297 | -0.340125 to -0.197843 |
| Candidate Bayesian MCMC | -0.260798 | 0.049688 | -0.357244 to -0.164967 |

Limitations:

- this is a pairwise class meta-analysis, not a full multi-treatment NMA;
- the current benchmark uses first-event binary counts, not time-to-event hazard ratios;
- the REML heterogeneity estimate is zero on this four-study fixture, so this is not evidence of random-effects superiority;
- PubMed/CT.gov source IDs are recorded, but full extraction provenance should later include machine-captured source snippets or checksums;
- this benchmark does not compare against `netmeta`, `multinma`, `MBNMAdose`, or `crossnma` yet.

## Static-Vs-Dynamic Hardcode Disclosure

| Item | Static or dynamic | Evidence source | Disclosure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trial arm counts | Static fixture | `sglt2_hf_primary_events.csv` plus `sglt2_hf_primary_sources.toml` | Treated as extracted source-backed data, not simulated output |
| Source manifest | Static fixture | PubMed abstract URLs and ClinicalTrials.gov record URLs | Machine-checked for identifier, outcome, source-type, and arm-count consistency |
| Independent fixed-effect reference | Dynamic computation | `bias_nma_adv.real_meta.fixed_effect_log_or_reference` | Recomputed by tests from the CSV rows |
| Pairwise bridge result | Dynamic computation | `bias_nma_adv.pairwise.fit_pairwise_meta` | Recomputed by tests from source-backed study-level effects |
| Candidate frequentist result | Dynamic computation | `AdvancedBiasAdjustedNMAPooler` | Recomputed by tests from the CSV rows |
| Candidate Bayesian result | Dynamic seeded computation | `BayesianNMAMCMCSampler` with seed 20260715 | Recomputed by tests with tolerance for sampler behavior |
| Certification status | Static contract | `sglt2_hf_primary_benchmark.toml` | `certification_effect = "none"` until external reference matching exists |
